# Portfolio

I have never worked directly with DDD but after several hours of research I realized that I am familiar with many of the underlying concepts that are used to implemement DDD.
I thought it would be a good challange to attempt to create a DDD solution for this presentation.

The attempt did not work out too well. I had a difficult time creating a dataset that was conducive with DDD.
I do have some questions regarding value-objects and the implications that immutable objects without IDs impose on a system as a whole. I would like to discuss this further

# Prototype

This is a dead prototype I created in 3 weeks. The code has been marked as throw away. I wrote all the code and did not get help on this prototype. I believe it is be a good exposition of my coding. 
The code is a proof of concept for a "lift and shift" and a foundation for future development. Coding effort was stopped suddenly and left in a Work In Progress state.
